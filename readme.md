# yokel
(working title)

a static site framework focused on tha user.

content in markdown, backed by git, powered by [choo],
and most importantly, editable by humans.

inspired by [prose], [jekyll], [editdata], [scully], [mulder], [rainbows]

- git deployments
- cli/api template based page generation
- markdown wysiwigs
- page updates are just commits
- drafts are maybe secretly PRs
- never show the user what they don't need to know
- git/github is for developers
- developers are not normal people
- no one should have to deal with low-level stuff to make a decent site
- basically jekyll but wordpress but node but choo

now i just have to write it
